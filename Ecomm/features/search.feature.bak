Feature: Search Page Validation
  As a shopper, I want to search using keywords, product names, or categories, 
  so that I can quickly find relevant products without browsing through multiple pages.

  Background:
    Given I am on the Product Listing Page

  @Sanity @PLP @Search @Sprint4
  Scenario: Search result page reflects input with full keyword
    Given I enter a valid full keyword search term and press Enter
    Then I should be navigated to the SRP
    And the header should display results for the full keyword

  @Sanity @PLP @Search @Sprint4
  Scenario: Search result page reflects input with partial keyword
    Given I enter a valid partial keyword search term and press Enter
    Then I should be navigated to the SRP
    And the header should display results for the partial keyword

  @Sanity @PLP @SearchSuggestions1 @Sprint4
  Scenario: Search suggestions not appear for two letter search term
    When I enter a two letter search term without pressing Enter
    Then I should not see search suggestions from products and categories

  @Sanity @PLP @SearchSuggestions @Sprint4
  Scenario: Search suggestions appear for valid search term
    When I enter a valid full keyword search term without pressing Enter

    Then I should be navigated to the category page

  @Sanity @PLP @Search1 @Sprint4
